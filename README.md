MAKSYM SEVERYN – SITE RELIABILITY ENGINEER



SUMMARY
As a SRE engineer, I possess a comprehensive understanding of the CI/CD concepts and have hands-on experience in automating build and deployment processes. I have worked extensively with GCP cloud services, including Compute Engine, VPC, IAM, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, GKE, and more. I'm proficient in creating and managing containerized applications using k8s cluster architecture. Also, I have experience using the kubectl command-line tool to manage resources, troubleshoot issues, and understand key components such as pods, services, and ingress controllers. My experience also extends to Linux administration and Infrastructure as Code solutions, such as Terraform.
